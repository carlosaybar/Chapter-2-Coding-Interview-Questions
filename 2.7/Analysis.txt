My algorithm has a time complexity of O(m+n) where m is the size of the first list and n is the size of the second list.
Given we are looking for the intersection or intersections  in the two lists, every instruction has to be executed no matter the size of both lists.
However, when we add m+n we will get a constant, and since constants do not really matter  when accounting for the time complexity of an algorithm, 
it can be said that the time complexity ends up being O(1).
